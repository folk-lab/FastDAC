# FastDAC
Arduino Code for FastDAC

Developed for arduino SAM cores library 1.6.12 but must have UARTClass.cpp in repo /corepatch folder copied over original core library, which addresses issue at: https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-sam/issues/64

On my Windows install this is located at:

C:\Users<UserName>\Documents\ArduinoData\packages\arduino\hardware\sam\1.6.12\cores\arduino

The other possible location depending on IDE version seems to be:

C:\Users<username>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\sam\1.6.12\cores\arduino

If you have both, best to overwrite them both.
